            <p>Autonarrs is a licensed North Carolina Used Car Dealer located just outside historic Warrenton, NC, and only a few minutes from beautiful Lake Gaston. We may be a little out of the way, but with our low overhead we can pass the savings on to you. And you'll save even more because, unlike other dealers, we don't charge an extra documentation fee.</p>
            <p>We are a small dealership and we work primarily by appointment. We don't play games and we don't have sales quotas. If you see something you like give us a call and set up an appointment. We'll be happy to meet you and show you what we have.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, whats with the name? Autonarr is the German word for car enthusiast or car nut. That describes us! We love cars -- classic, new, fancy, no frills or totally unique. We'd like to hear your car stories.</p>
